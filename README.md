# Statistical-Methods-in-Data-Analysis
I took Statistical Methods in Data Science, a graduate level course taught by Professor Darren Grant at UAlberta in 2011/2012. All assignments involved coding statistical concepts in C++.

The topics covered were:
Probability Distribution Functions, their application and Confidence Intervals
Parameter Estimation
Goodness of Fit
Method of Least Squares
General Likelihood and Multivariate Methods
Bayesian Statistics
Transformation/Inversion MC Techniques

The submitted assignments find their final resting place in this repository.
